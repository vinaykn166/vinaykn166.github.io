# Welcome to My Portfolio Project  

*A hands-on demonstration of how I approach technical documentation.*

As a freelance **technical writer** with experience using React and Markdown, I built this site to explore **Docusaurus**, experiment with developer-focused tooling, and showcase my ability to create structured, navigable, and developer-friendly content.

This project gave me the opportunity to apply those skills in a real-world context. I designed and built a modern documentation site from the ground up.

Feel free to explore. The layout, organization, and tone are all intentional: focused on **usability**, clarity, and a strong developer experience.

If you're looking for a writer who can deliver **concise**, technically accurate documentation that integrates smoothly into your workflow, Iâ€™d love to connect.
