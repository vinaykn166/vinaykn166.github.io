# About Me

## 👋 Hi There {#hi-there}

**I'm a freelance technical writer who makes complex tools easier to understand.**

✍️ I specialize in clear, user-focused documentation, including user guides, onboarding content, developer docs, and internal tools.

💡 With a background in translation, web development, and IT support, I bring a cross-disciplinary perspective to every project and pick up new tools quickly. I aim to make information clear, consistent, and accessible, especially for global and non-native English-speaking audiences.

📘 **Documentation isn’t a side note. It’s how your product speaks.**

## 🧩 How I Can Help {#how-i-can-help}

I help teams work more efficiently and support multilingual audiences by creating clear, practical documentation, especially for non-native English speakers.

The main ways I can help include:
- ✅ **Reducing support tickets** with effective self-service content  
- ✅ **Streamlining employee onboarding** through structured guides  
- ✅ **Driving feature adoption** with clear, actionable walkthroughs  

## ✍️ My Approach {#my-approach}

*You know your product best*. I learn how it works, ask the right questions, and turn it into clear, useful documentation. Research lays the foundation. Clarity makes it work.

I’ve developed a **writing workflow** that includes:

- Research and source review
- Collaborating with subject matter experts
- Drafting in plain language
- Reviewing and revising based on collaborative input
- Using and adapting to documentation tools such as Confluence, GitHub, and CMS platforms

## 💼 Relevant Background {#relevant-background}
While I'm early in my technical writing career, my background in **IT support**, **web development**, and **translation** has given me strong foundations in technical communication. These roles taught me how to understand complex systems, **communicate across teams**, and write for a **global audience**.

I recently completed a short-term tech writing role, contributing to **internal documentation** and onboarding materials.
